{"openapi":"3.0.0","info":{"version":"1.5.0","title":"Track & Trace Events","description":"Retrieve Track & Trace Events based on DCSA Interface standard v.2.2\n\nThis service provides visibility to Shipment, Equipment and Transport events for shipments booked with A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S using standards set by the **<a href=\"https://dcsa.org/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><u>Digital Container Shipping Association</u></a>**.  \n\n# Overview\nThis service returns all events filtered by the queryParameters.  This endpoint requires **at least one** of the following input parameters:\n    \n* carrierBookingReference\n* transportDocumentReference\n* equipmentReference\n    \n**Note:** It is possible to combine queryParameters. When combining queryParameters be aware that it is also possible to make combinations that are mutually contradicting.  For example, shipmentEventTypeCode=DRFT and equipmentEventTypeCode=GTIN; since there is no event that can be a ShipmentEvent and an EquipmentEvent at the same time this will return an empty list.\n\n**Important:** A 404 'Not Found' response status code is returned if your OAuth 2.0 client is not configured with a Maersk Customer Code that is a party to the shipment.  If you feel you have received this response in error, it is likely that your client ID must be reconfigured.
