{"openapi":"3.0.3","info":{"title":"Ocean - Commercial Schedules [DCSA]","description":"Retrieve vessel schedules, cargo routings and port schedules based on the Commercial Schedules standard by the\n [Digital Container Shipping Association](https://dcsa.org/standards/commercial-schedules/)\n\n# Overview\nStreamline your logistics processes with the DCSA-compliant Commercial Schedules API based on the **<a href=\"https://dcsa.org/standards/commercial-schedules\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-weight: bold;\">DCSA Interface standard v.1.0.1</a>**. This API simplifies integration, reduces manual steps, and ensures consistent data across carriers and platforms.\n\n# Why use it?\n\n\n  The DCSA Commercial Schedules (CS) standard creates a common way for carriers to communicate vessel schedule information to customers. With the DCSA CS standard in place, customers can expect to receive high-quality data about their container shipments regardless of which carrier is transporting them. CS provides three options for accessing schedules from carriers: \n\n  - **Point- to-Point Routing**: provides single or multiple end-to-end routing options with estimated timestamps during the pre-booking phase; \n  - **Port Schedule**: provides estimated timestamps for all vessels arriving and departing from a defined port/terminal on a given date; \n  - **Vessel Schedules**: provides estimated departure and arrival times for a required service, voyage or vessel, for each port call on the vessel’s rotation. \n\n\n  # Deprecation  of legacy Schedule APIs\n  \n  With the release of the **DCSA Commercial Schedules API**, we are beginning the retirement of two legacy APIs.  \n    The following APIs are **deprecated** and scheduled for decommissioning:  \n    -  **<a href=\"https://edpmediastorage.blob.core.windows.net/media/vessel_schedules_v1-2_22112023_scalar_spec.yaml\"\n      target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><u>Vessel Schedules</u></a>**  \n    - **<a href=\"https://edpmediastorage.blob.core.windows.net/media/p2p_schedules_v2-2_13082024_scalar_spec.yaml\"\n      target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><u>Point-to-Point Schedules</u></a>**  \n\nThe legacy **Vessel Schedules** and **Point-to-Point Schedules** APIs will remain available until **September 1, 2026**.\\\nAfter this date, both APIs will be **permanently decommissioned** and no longer supported.\\\nWe recommend migrating to the new API as early as possible to avoid service disruption. For migration guidance, please **<a href=\"https://developer.maersk.com/contact-us\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-weight: bold;\">contact our support team</a>**.\n\n# Who can get access?\nAll registered users of the Maersk Developer Portal can get access to the API.\n\n# Getting started\n\nAccess to this API is limited to approved developers currently doing business with Maersk.

Among them, the `/vessel-schedules` and `port-schedules` endpoints are enhanced versions of the existing Vessel Schedules API, offering additional features and improved functionality. Key enhancements include:\n  - Adoption of the DCSA standard data model\n  - Support for industry-standard codes (e.g., UN/LOCODE, SMDG facility codes, vessel IMO numbers)\n  - Support schedules by service - The data structure has been redesigned in the DCSA version to organize schedules by service instead of by vessel\n  - Inclusion of UTC timezone offsets for departureDate and arrivalDate\n  - Support for `PLN`, `EST` and `ACT` event classifier codes\n  - Full voyage coverage\n  - Flexible schedules query options using: UNLocationCode, facilitySMDGCode, vesselOperatorCarrierCode, carrierServiceCode, carrierVoyageNumber, and any of these combinations\n  - Pagination support for efficient data handling\n\n\n\n**Q: What is the difference between the DCSA Commercial Schedules API and the existing Point-to-Point Schedules API?**\\\nA: The DCSA Commercial Schedules API includes three endpoints. The `/point-to-point-routes` endpoint is an enhanced version of the existing Point-to-Point Schedules API, offering additional features and improved functionality. Key enhancements include:\n  - Adoption of the DCSA standard data model\n  - Support for industry-standard codes (e.g., UN/LOCODE, SMDG facility codes, vessel IMO numbers)\n  - Inclusion of UTC timezone offsets for departureDate and arrivalDate\n  - Ability to filter routings by the maximum number of transhipments using the new `maxTranshipment` query parameter\n  - Introduction of `routingReference` to associate routings with bookings (new feature coming in 2026 with the **<a\nhref=\"https://developer.maersk.com/api-catalogue/EDP%20Booking\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-weight: bold;\">DCSA Booking API v2</a>**)\n\n**Q: Does the API support pagination?**\\\nA: Yes, pagination is supported on the `/vessel-schedules` and `/port-schedules` endpoints. However, the `/point-to-point-routes` endpoint does not support pagination due to backend system restrictions.\n\n**Q: Does the API provide cutOffTimes or deadlines?**\\\nA: Not currently. Support for cut-off times is planned and included in our product backlog for Q4 2025.\n\n**Q: Does the `/point-to-to-routes` endpoint support Named Account routes?**\\\nA: Not currently. However, support for Named Account routes is on our product roadmap for 2026.\n","contact":{"name":"External APIs","email":"xdmaerskapisteam@maersk.com","url":"https://developer.maersk.com/contact-us"},"license":{"url":"https://terms.maersk.com/api-license-terms","name":"Maersk 1.0"},"version":"1.0.1","x-release-notes":"# Version     Date     Notes\n# 1.0.1    2025-06-31  the first release\n","x-spectral":{"ignore":["path-parameters-camelCase-alphanumeric","properties-camelCase-alphanumeric"]}},"servers":[{"url":"https://api.maersk.com/ocean/commercial-schedules/dcsa","description":"Production Environment"},{"url":"https://api-stage.maersk.com/ocean/commercial-schedules/dcsa","description":"Pre-Production Environment"},{"url":"https://api-cdt.maersk.com/ocean/commercial-schedules/dcsa","description":"Test Environment"}],"security":[{"ApiKeyHeader":[]}],"tags":[{"name":"Point To Point","description":" "},{"name":"Port Schedule","description":" "},{"name":"Vessel Schedule","description":" "}],"paths":{"/v1/point-to-point-routes":{"get":{"tags":["Point To Point"],"summary":"Point to Point Routing","description":"Provides the product offering of single or multiple estimated end-to-end route options for a shipment in the pre-booking phase.

Examples of typical query parameters and expected payload returned in the response:\n\n- a) `carrierServiceCode`: Get all vessels and their full voyages within a service   \n\n- b) `carrierServiceCode` **&** `carrierVoyageNumber`: Get a specific full voyage within a service\n\n- c) `carrierServiceCode` **&** `vesselIMONumber`: Get a specific vessel’s full voyages within a service. \n\n- d) `vesselIMONumber`: Get all full voyages for a specific vessel across all the services in which it is involved.\n\n- e) `UNLocationCode`: Get all vessels and their full voyages where the specific `UNLocationCode` is involved\n\n- f) `UNLocationCode` **&** `facilitySMDGCode`: Get all vessels and their full voyages where the specific  `UNLocationCode` and `facilitySMDGCode` is involved\n\nOther combinations using `vesselName`, `universalServiceReference`, `universalVoyageReference`, `vesselOperatorCarrierCode`, `startDate`, `endDate` are possible. \n\nThe filter parameters `startDate` and `endDate` MUST always be used in combination with any of the other available parameters.\n\nThe resulting payload returned in the responses will always include **entire voyage(s) being matched**. This means that even though a filter only matches a single `Port` (`UNLocationCode`) in a `Voyage` or a single `Timestamp` within a `Port` in a `Voyage` - **the entire Voyage matched** is returned. If the `carrierImportVoyageNumber` of the `Port` differs from the `carrierExportVoyageNumber` of the `Port` then the **entire Voyage** for both these Voyage numbers are included. An example of this is when `&UNLocationCode=DEHAM` is used as a filter parameter. In this case **entire Voyages** would be listed where `DEHAM` is a `Port`.\n\nBe aware that it is possible to specify filters that are mutually exclusive resulting in an empty response list. An example of this could be when both using `vesselIMONumber` and `vesselName` filters at the same time: `&vesselIMONumber=9321483&vesselName=King of the Seas`. If no `Vessel` exists where `vesselIMONumber` is **9321483** and `vesselName` is **King of the Seas** then the result will be an empty list. \n\nIf no `startDate` filter is provided, then **3 months** before the request date should be used as default.
